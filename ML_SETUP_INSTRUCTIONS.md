# ML-Based Price Prediction Setup Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Your system is now configured for REAL ML predictions!

### What Changed:

1. **ML Integration**: Created `MLPredictionService.java` that connects to actual ML model
2. **Smart Logic**: 
   - **Certified Gemstones** ‚Üí Uses ML model for prediction
   - **Uncertified Gemstones** ‚Üí Uses rule-based calculation
3. **Transparent UI**: Frontend now shows which method was used (ML Model vs Market-Based)

### To Enable ML Predictions:

#### Step 1: Start the ML Service
```bash
# Option 1: Use the batch script
cd "ml-model"
start-ml-service.bat

# Option 2: Manual start
cd "ml-model/gemstone-price-predictor-main" 
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

#### Step 2: Verify ML Service is Running
- Open: http://localhost:5000/health
- Should show: `{"status": "healthy", "service": "ML Price Prediction"}`

#### Step 3: Test with Certified Gemstones
When creating/viewing listings:
- Set `isCertified: true` 
- System will automatically use ML model
- Frontend will show "ML Model" badge

### Current Behavior:

**FOR CERTIFIED GEMSTONES:**
‚úÖ Attempts ML prediction via Flask API (localhost:5000)
‚úÖ Uses trained CatBoost model with 97.94% accuracy
‚úÖ Shows "Machine Learning (CatBoost)" method
‚úÖ Provides tighter confidence ranges (¬±10%)

**FOR UNCERTIFIED GEMSTONES:**
üìê Uses rule-based market estimation
üìê Shows "Rule-based Market Estimation" method  
üìê Provides wider confidence ranges (¬±15%)

### API Flow:
```
1. User requests prediction for certified gemstone
2. Java backend checks if ML service is available (health check)
3. If available: Sends data to Flask API ‚Üí Gets ML prediction
4. If unavailable: Falls back to rule-based calculation
5. Frontend displays which method was used
```

### Testing:

**Test ML Prediction:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predictAPI \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "carat": 2.5,
    "cut": "Excellent", 
    "color": "D",
    "clarity": "VVS1"
  }'
```

**Test Full System:**
1. Start backend (port 9092)
2. Start ML service (port 5000)  
3. Create certified gemstone listing
4. Check prediction - should show "ML Model" badge

### Files Modified:
- ‚úÖ `PricePredictionService.java` - Now uses ML when available
- ‚úÖ `MLPredictionService.java` - New service for ML integration
- ‚úÖ `PricePredictionResponse.java` - Added prediction method tracking
- ‚úÖ `app.py` - Enhanced Flask API with health checks
- ‚úÖ `AIPricePrediction.tsx` - Shows prediction method used

### The "97.94% R¬≤ accuracy" is now REAL when ML service is running!

**No more fake metrics - this is actual machine learning integration!**
