# 🔓 No-Show Management System Updates

## Overview
Enhanced the No-Show Management system to include administrative grace when unblocking users by automatically reducing their no-show count by 1.

## 🎯 Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend Updates (NoShowManagementService.java)

#### **Enhanced unblockUser Method**
- **New Feature**: Automatically reduces no-show count by 1 when unblocking a user
- **Safety Check**: Only reduces count if it's greater than 0 (prevents negative counts)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logs showing count reduction
- **Response Data**: Includes new no-show count in the response

```java
// Reduce no-show count by 1 as administrative grace when unblocking
int currentNoShowCount = user.getNoShowCount();
if (currentNoShowCount > 0) {
    user.setNoShowCount(currentNoShowCount - 1);
    logger.info("🔄 Reduced no-show count from {} to {} for unblocked user {}", 
               currentNoShowCount, currentNoShowCount - 1, userId);
}
```

### 2. Frontend Updates
